# Retail-Delivery-Optimization

Managed AWS S3 data lake and ETL pipelines to enhance retail analytics, improving delivery efficiency. Automated data workflows to generate daily actionable, boosting operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Series of ETL jobs are programmed as part of this project using python, SQL, Airflow, and Spark to build pipelines that download data from an AWS S3 bucket, apply some manipulations, and then load the cleaned-up data set into another location on the same AWS S3 bucket for higher level analytics.
